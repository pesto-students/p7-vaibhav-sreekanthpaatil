/* 
Explaination:
The expected output is 3 but the actual output is 0;
This is because in log() we are printing the message and not the actual count.
So when log() is called in line 16:
line 8 is executed ->
 message is on line 6 -> 
 but in line 6 it is finding for count -> 
 count is found on line2 in the lexical scope -> 
 but its initialized at 0;
